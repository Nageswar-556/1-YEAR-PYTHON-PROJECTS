"In my college Python class, I developed several projects, including a Weather API, Warehouse Management System, Traffic Monitoring Tool, COVID-19 Tracker, and Inventory Management System. 
   These projects allowed me to apply Python programming in diverse domains, enhancing my skills in API integration, data handling, and problem-solving. With a strong foundation in Python, 
   I am confident in designing and implementing independent projects to solve real-world challenges."
